# Chandler's Points (for BCC)
##### Cap on member bookings and render bookings for only 2 weeks at a time (timeline can be adjusted later)
##### Consultation for member to be paired with tennis instructor -> joey adds pairing for member id-coach id
##### add more accurate data (package information, court reservations,  kids registration)
##### create mobile app for push notifications for easy access when on court
##### add for pickleball/padel (according to club)
##### dropdown of lesson duration times before booking (30 min, 1 hour, 1 hr 30)
##### ability to create new booking and choose which family member next booking is for

### members that refuse to use website/app can call or email -> admin will update 
### guests (non-members) of resort or club can call or email -> admin will update

# AI Intelligence

     – Resource tracking (equipment, staff, and maintenance schedules).
    • Event and League Management:
     – End-to-end support for events: registration, scheduling, results entry, and reporting.
     – Automated tournament bracket generation and real-time contest scheduling.
    • Financial Management:
     – Integrated payment processing (subscriptions, one-time fees, refunds) with multi-currency support.
     – Detailed invoicing and accounting modules with reporting and dashboard visualizations.
    • Marketing & Communication:
     – Integrated communication tools (email, SMS, push notifications, in-app messaging).
     – Marketing automation (segmented campaigns, reminders, loyalty programs).
    • Advanced Analytics and AI Integration:
     – Real-time dashboards with KPIs covering operational metrics, member behavior, and event performance.
     – Predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting membership growth, player performance, facility usage) powered by AI/ML.
    • Omnichannel Engagement:
     – Seamless experiences across mobile apps, web portals, and possibly kiosks or digital signage.

    1.3. Integration Requirements
    • API-First Design:
     – Provide robust REST or GraphQL APIs for third-party integrations (CRM, ERP, social media, wearable devices).
     – Support secure data exchange between modules and external systems.
    • Multi-Tenancy & Localization:
     – Support for multiple clubs/resorts with isolated data environments.
     – Built-in localization (multi-language, regional formats, multi-currency).

2. Non-Functional Requirements
    2.1. Scalability and Performance
    • Scalability:
     – Must support horizontal scaling (adding additional servers or cloud instances) to handle growing user loads.
    • Performance:
     – System response time should be under 2 seconds for typical requests even at peak load.
     – Real-time processing for dashboards and analytics.

    2.2. Security & Compliance
    • Data Security:
     – End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit (e.g., TLS, AES-256).
     – Implement RBAC, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and audit logging.
    • Compliance:
     – Adhere to relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) with granular consent management.
     – Regular security assessments and penetration testing.

    2.3. Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability
    • High Availability:
     – Target at least 99.9% uptime with disaster recovery and failover mechanisms.
    • Maintainability:
     – Use modular, well-documented code and design patterns to facilitate future enhancements.
     – Provide detailed API documentation and developer guides.

    2.4. Usability
    • Intuitive Interfaces:
     – Role-tailored dashboards and an administrative console that are user friendly and require minimal training.
     – Support for responsive design across devices.

3. Back-End Management Implementation Guidelines
    3.1. Technology Stack and Architecture
    • Framework and Language:
     – Choose a robust, enterprise-grade back-end framework (e.g., ASP.NET Core, Java Spring Boot, or Node.js with TypeScript) that supports microservices if needed.
    • Database:
     – Use a scalable relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server) with proper indexing and caching strategies (Redis, Memcached).
    • API Gateway & Microservices:
     – Consider a microservices architecture with an API gateway to manage, monitor, and secure service calls.

    3.2. Infrastructure
    • Cloud Deployment:
     – Use cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalability, load balancing, and disaster recovery.
    • CI/CD Pipelines:
     – Set up automated testing, integration, and deployment pipelines (using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps).

    3.3. Monitoring and Logging
    • Monitoring:
     – Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) to track real-time performance and usage patterns.
    • Logging:
     – Use centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) to collect and analyze logs for troubleshooting and auditing.

    3.4. Security Measures
    • Authentication & Authorization:
     – Implement OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication.
    • API Security:
     – Use rate limiting, input validation, and API gateways to secure endpoints.

    3.5. Starting the Back-End Implementation
    Requirements Review & Gap Analysis:
     – Begin by comparing your current implementation against the above Tier 4 requirements to identify missing features (e.g., advanced analytics, customizable modules, multi-tenancy).
    Modularization:
     – Refactor your back end into clearly defined modules or services, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., user management, event scheduling, financial processing).
    API-First Approach:
     – Design and document APIs for each module using standards like OpenAPI/Swagger.
    Integration & Data Strategy:
     – Ensure that each module can exchange data seamlessly with others, possibly by implementing an event-driven architecture.
    Security Implementation:
     – Prioritize implementing robust security measures early (e.g., encrypt sensitive data, secure API endpoints, and use RBAC).
    Testing & Monitoring:
     – Develop a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and performance tests, and set up monitoring and logging from day one.
